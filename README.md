# Plotly_-_Belly_Button_Biodiversity
Module 12

## Project Overview

For this project, a dashboard was created to display results of bacterial analysis performed on samples from anonymous donors. The donors can check their results based on their ID number. The samples are conducted to find candidate bacteria to flavor a synthetic meat product so we want to find the bellybutton bacteria that tastes the beefiest.

Hovering over the bubbles or bars in the charts will show details:

The dashboard was customized with a background image, font color change for contrast over the jumbotron image, transparency added to the Plotly objects, and a solid background color for the body of the page.
